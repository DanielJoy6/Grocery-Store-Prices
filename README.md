# Grocery-Store-Prices

I wrote this program to try and automatically get grocery store prices.
- My intiial attempt was through the requests library, which failed
- Next was Selenium, which also failed, as all websites detected that I was a robot.
- Finally I used PyAutoGui and went to the websites manually, letting the Python script move/type for me


Currently, there are lots of improvements to be made.
